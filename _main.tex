This book contains the results from the anonymous team surveys among members of the \href{https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/}{R/Bioconductor-powered Team Data Science} group. This survey is a modified version from the one shared publicly by \href{https://twitter.com/leslievosshall}{Leslie Vosshall, PhD} on \href{https://twitter.com/leslievosshall/status/1371260850657460227?s=20}{Twitter}. Any responses inside the text marks \texttt{\textless{}redact\textgreater{}\ some\ text\ \textless{}/redact\textgreater{}} was automatically removed.

Answers shown below have been randomized such that the author of response 1 to question 1 is not necessarily the same author of response 1 to question 2. This helps keeps responses across questions anonymous.

As promised, this book shows the answers such that everyone in the team and benefit and reflect on them. Thank you very much for participating!

The PDF version of this book is available \href{_main.pdf}{here}.

  Learning loads of things that are really helpful for my scientific career in a team where everyone is happy to help, and where the PI is giving me feedback and pushing me to grow. Also I like that the human part is not lost.

  Support for learning and career development at every stage
\item
  Getting to learn so many new things in a not super stressful way

  Lots of room to grow, no expectation that you know everything, and very supportive of people learning new things

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Social life is right
\item
  Hard to answer this question given that we've been WFH for over a year - I think we are the right amount of social
\item
  It feels not quite social enough, but this probably mostly has to do with inherent COVID restrictions which can't be easily avoided. I'm not sure the best way to improve.
\item
  I think we are doing what we can with the extenuating circumstances. I am glad we are getting back to doing happy hours now the weather is nice.
\item
  once the pandemic is closer i think the team will get to know each other better.
\item
  I think we could be a bit more social, but it's difficult right now during the pandemic

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I liked discussing the ``nuts and bolts'' of our cluster usage/needs. Maybe we can focus some of our lab discussions on the tech/code side in addition to the science side. Also we never really put together the code review sessions and I feel like that would be a useful tool. Some times I am unsure which meetings I am expected to attend.
\item
  On personal projects, it's sometimes hard to get as much external feedback as would be ideal. Assigning multiple people to a particular project can improve internal communication and reduce the need for frequent feedback from you.
\item
  I think it is ok and slack is a perfect platform to do it.
\item
  We need to encourage more collaboration to develop less experienced members as well as encourage people to ask for help faster.
\item
  I feel like whatever answer I would give to this question is less relevant now that Lieber is opening back up
\item
  I think that we communicate very well.

  they're more or less fine as-is. The only thing I can think of that could be useful is having someone take meeting notes, so we know what was covered. Not urgent though.

  I think our meetings are very productive.
\item
  It's nice to hear what everyone is up to in their individual projects, but its not always useful (it can be easy to check out). Maybe we could make the Notion board more of a part of it? Do a number rundown (we put up x number of tasks to do and got y done). It can be easy to forget the Notion board since we don't really engage with it at meetings. My favorite part of the when everyone gets chatting about a subject work related or not.

  Sometimes journal club is on topics that are very far outside my realm of knowledge and the work I do. But that's ok because I get to learn about new things.

  some sort of shared repository for notes, or summary

  No.

  Yes, maybe every 6 months.

  It was useful, but it was a bit long. I think yearly for something this long, maybe something more concise if we would do it with more frequency. Also in a group this small I feel like it is only so anonymous and we have a lot of discussions about this kind of stuff as a group already.\\
\item
  Somewhat. This could maybe be a yearly thing (or a couple times a year).
\item
  Yes
\item
  The survey is good and could be conducted annually. Some of the 1-10 questions could confuse people wo don't read the question well enough on their initial read (like me), because they use the 10-end of the scale to represent a lower magnitude of something bad (like `Not pressured') and the 1-end of the scale to represent a higher magnitude of something bad (like `Very pressured'). Ultimately not a problem for me because I re-read the scale labels but this might cause some erroneous answers.

  Yes
