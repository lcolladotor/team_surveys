This book contains the results from the anonymous team surveys among members of the \href{https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/}{R/Bioconductor-powered Team Data Science} group. This survey is a modified version from the one shared publicly by \href{https://twitter.com/leslievosshall}{Leslie Vosshall, PhD} on \href{https://twitter.com/leslievosshall/status/1371260850657460227?s=20}{Twitter}. Any responses inside the text marks \texttt{\textless{}redact\textgreater{}\ some\ text\ \textless{}/redact\textgreater{}} was automatically removed.

Answers shown below have been randomized such that the author of response 1 to question 1 is not necessarily the same author of response 1 to question 2. This helps keeps responses across questions anonymous.

As promised, this book shows the answers such that everyone in the team can benefit and reflect on them. Thank you very much for participating!

The PDF version of this book is available \href{_main.pdf}{here}.

  Between compensation, attitude, and just poor collaborators there are large parts of the institute that have alienated themselves and I no longer have interest in working with. This feeling has moved from a couple PIs to include administration and leadership as well.

\item
  It can feel easy to get lost regarding the purpose or plans behind projects I work alone on.
\item
  sometimes there could be communication difficulties (but very rarely in this team, this is rather a wider LIBD issue)
\item
  Worried that there is a ceiling for my career at LIBD. I also get the feeling that there are some difficult politics that I'm not totally aware of, and the institute as a whole feels a bit disconnected.

  It is just right.

  I think we could be a bit more social, I think the return of social lunch is a step in the right direction! Maybe we can try a few more after-work gatherings that aren't always alcohol centered (go get coffee, a snack, or ice-cream instead?).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Being in person could help. Also I think there's going to be more pressure on us to give services to other labs and Leo should be the point person for that. I don't like being reached out to by other PIs to ask me to do things outside my responsibilities.
\item
  It's sometimes hard to see how projects are connected or who is working on what. Team meetings that clarify this are helpful
\item
  Maybe take time (like 10 min) during the Wednesday team meetings to check in with everyone about progress on projects. It is sometimes a really long time before the cycle of presentations to get all the way around, and its nice to hear the progress people have made. This also might be a good way to make connections about similar problems/questions. Also better reminders about what is happening at the team meeting from the person going to present would be helpful for the rest of the group to prep.\\
\item
  I feel we communicate well but sometimes the important information is lost in slack messages but there has never been an issue.
\item
  Slack, Calendly, and Google doc have been very powerful, I think, to facilitate our communications.
\item
  Slack's good.

  Cannot say much as I do not participate in the weekly team meetings. But maybe going over some basics as we work with different people who have different levels of computational knowledge. Going over the basics in brief will help everyone come to the same a page.

  There are tons of projects happening which can be hard to keep track of when you're not a part of them. Maybe we can have a google doc or website where each team shares a few resources for people to take a look at and get a better idea of what is happening if a project sounds interesting to them.

  Group meetings are really helpful when they're among people that are working on very closely related projects. However, in many of the meetings there are too many people. I think the smaller the group meeting, the more productive it is.

  A lot of people will still have meetings without giving much to prep with.
\item
  No, stay as it is.

  Sorry, I don't get what sub-group meetings are.

  some of these sub-group meetings could be replaced by asynchronous communication in writing - by Slack or email

  na. Sometimes we end up doing things in our meeting that are different from my expectations/agenda. That tends to throw me off a bit, but perhaps it's the nature of the work.

  Yes, it felt more useful the first time we did it. Its pretty long and since there were no drastic changes from last year so it felt a bit redundant at times. Yearly is probably the correct interval but maybe extract some questions sections out for their own survey, for instance the ``Mentoring'' questions may be best to ask after we have done performance reviews/career meetings for the year so that experience is fresh. I think if it was more concise I could be more sure I gave high quality answers for each point.

  It's nice to hear what everyone is up to in their individual projects, but its not always useful (it can be easy to check out). Maybe we could make the Notion board more of a part of it? Do a number rundown (we put up x number of tasks to do and got y done). It can be easy to forget the Notion board since we don't really engage with it at meetings. My favorite part of the when everyone gets chatting about a subject work related or not.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The survey is good and could be conducted annually. Some of the 1-10 questions could confuse people wo don't read the question well enough on their initial read (like me), because they use the 10-end of the scale to represent a lower magnitude of something bad (like `Not pressured') and the 1-end of the scale to represent a higher magnitude of something bad (like `Very pressured'). Ultimately not a problem for me because I re-read the scale labels but this might cause some erroneous answers.
\item
  Somewhat. This could maybe be a yearly thing (or a couple times a year).
\item
  It was useful, but it was a bit long. I think yearly for something this long, maybe something more concise if we would do it with more frequency. Also in a group this small I feel like it is only so anonymous and we have a lot of discussions about this kind of stuff as a group already.\\

  Yes, maybe every 6 months.
