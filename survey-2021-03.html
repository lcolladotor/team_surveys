<li>Social life is right</li>
<li>once the pandemic is closer i think the team will get to know each other better.</li>
<li>It feels not quite social enough, but this probably mostly has to do with inherent COVID restrictions which can’t be easily avoided. I’m not sure the best way to improve.</li>
<li>Hard to answer this question given that we’ve been WFH for over a year - I think we are the right amount of social</li>
<li>I think we could be a bit more social, but it’s difficult right now during the pandemic</li>
<li>I think we are doing what we can with the extenuating circumstances. I am glad we are getting back to doing happy hours now the weather is nice.</li>

<ul>
<li>I feel like whatever answer I would give to this question is less relevant now that Lieber is opening back up</li>
<li>I think that we communicate very well.</li>
<li>We need to encourage more collaboration to develop less experienced members as well as encourage people to ask for help faster.</li>
<li>On personal projects, it’s sometimes hard to get as much external feedback as would be ideal. Assigning multiple people to a particular project can improve internal communication and reduce the need for frequent feedback from you.</li>
<li>I think it is ok and slack is a perfect platform to do it.</li>
<li>I liked discussing the “nuts and bolts” of our cluster usage/needs. Maybe we can focus some of our lab discussions on the tech/code side in addition to the science side. Also we never really put together the code review sessions and I feel like that would be a useful tool. Some times I am unsure which meetings I am expected to attend.</li>

My favorite part of the when everyone gets chatting about a subject work related or not.</li>

<ul>
<li>The survey is good and could be conducted annually. Some of the 1-10 questions could confuse people wo don’t read the question well enough on their initial read (like me), because they use the 10-end of the scale to represent a lower magnitude of something bad (like ‘Not pressured’) and the 1-end of the scale to represent a higher magnitude of something bad (like ‘Very pressured’). Ultimately not a problem for me because I re-read the scale labels but this might cause some erroneous answers.</li>
<li>Somewhat. This could maybe be a yearly thing (or a couple times a year).</li>
<li>It was useful, but it was a bit long. I think yearly for something this long, maybe something more concise if we would do it with more frequency. Also in a group this small I feel like it is only so anonymous and we have a lot of discussions about this kind of stuff as a group already.<br />
</li>
<li>Yes, maybe every 6 months.</li>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>Yes</li>
