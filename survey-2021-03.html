<li>Hard to answer this question given that we’ve been WFH for over a year - I think we are the right amount of social</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.12</span> What are some ways that we could improve communication in the team?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I liked discussing the “nuts and bolts” of our cluster usage/needs. Maybe we can focus some of our lab discussions on the tech/code side in addition to the science side. Also we never really put together the code review sessions and I feel like that would be a useful tool. Some times I am unsure which meetings I am expected to attend.</li>
<li>On personal projects, it’s sometimes hard to get as much external feedback as would be ideal. Assigning multiple people to a particular project can improve internal communication and reduce the need for frequent feedback from you.</li>
<li>I think it is ok and slack is a perfect platform to do it.</li>
<li>We need to encourage more collaboration to develop less experienced members as well as encourage people to ask for help faster.</li>
<li>I feel like whatever answer I would give to this question is less relevant now that Lieber is opening back up</li>
<li>I think that we communicate very well.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.53</span> If we had the funds to hire one more full-time person, what kind of person should we hire and what role would they play in the team?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I’m not sure about that</li>
<li>I’m not sure what is needed.</li>
<li>Staff scientist level/post-doc would be perfect</li>
<li>Someone who has strong R and or python skills and has studied/and experience in bioinformatics. As for role, more analysis work (idk this is a hard one to answer)</li>
<li>A math-y person to help explain the type of statistics we use.</li>
<li>I feel like someone to take some of the pressure off your load would be helpful to the team. You seem very busy and sometimes it would be nice to have someone with about your level of knowledge and experience (or even slightly less) to consult about certain issues.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.56</span> Finally, did you find this survey useful? If yes, how often should the survey be conducted?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Yes, maybe every 6 months.</li>
<li>It was useful, but it was a bit long. I think yearly for something this long, maybe something more concise if we would do it with more frequency. Also in a group this small I feel like it is only so anonymous and we have a lot of discussions about this kind of stuff as a group already.<br />
</li>
<li>Somewhat. This could maybe be a yearly thing (or a couple times a year).</li>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>The survey is good and could be conducted annually. Some of the 1-10 questions could confuse people wo don’t read the question well enough on their initial read (like me), because they use the 10-end of the scale to represent a lower magnitude of something bad (like ‘Not pressured’) and the 1-end of the scale to represent a higher magnitude of something bad (like ‘Very pressured’). Ultimately not a problem for me because I re-read the scale labels but this might cause some erroneous answers.</li>
<li>Yes</li>
