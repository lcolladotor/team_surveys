<ul>
<li>Being in person could help. Also I think there’s going to be more pressure on us to give services to other labs and Leo should be the point person for that. I don’t like being reached out to by other PIs to ask me to do things outside my responsibilities.</li>
<li>It’s sometimes hard to see how projects are connected or who is working on what. Team meetings that clarify this are helpful</li>
<li>Maybe take time (like 10 min) during the Wednesday team meetings to check in with everyone about progress on projects. It is sometimes a really long time before the cycle of presentations to get all the way around, and its nice to hear the progress people have made. This also might be a good way to make connections about similar problems/questions. Also better reminders about what is happening at the team meeting from the person going to present would be helpful for the rest of the group to prep.<br />
</li>
<li>I feel we communicate well but sometimes the important information is lost in slack messages but there has never been an issue.</li>
<li>Slack, Calendly, and Google doc have been very powerful, I think, to facilitate our communications.</li>
<li>Slack’s good.</li>

<ul>
<li>N/A</li>
<li>Cannot say much as I do not participate in the weekly team meetings. But maybe going over some basics as we work with different people who have different levels of computational knowledge. Going over the basics in brief will help everyone come to the same a page.</li>
<li>There are tons of projects happening which can be hard to keep track of when you’re not a part of them. Maybe we can have a google doc or website where each team shares a few resources for people to take a look at and get a better idea of what is happening if a project sounds interesting to them.</li>

<li>Group meetings are really helpful when they’re among people that are working on very closely related projects. However, in many of the meetings there are too many people. I think the smaller the group meeting, the more productive it is.</li>
<li>A lot of people will still have meetings without giving much to prep with.</li>
<li>No, stay as it is.</li>
<li>Sorry, I don’t get what sub-group meetings are.</li>
<li>some of these sub-group meetings could be replaced by asynchronous communication in writing - by Slack or email</li>
<li>No</li>
<li>na. Sometimes we end up doing things in our meeting that are different from my expectations/agenda. That tends to throw me off a bit, but perhaps it’s the nature of the work.</li>
<li>More frequently developing an agenda (especially if multiple groups have updates/work to present)</li>

<li>I wonder if we can have it in a smaller group for those who are not as extraverted. Having it in a spatial group meeting is sometimes overwhelming.</li>
<li>no</li>
<li>Maybe talk about how useful the journal club tools or packages are for our data.</li>
<li>I think journal club should only be done in sub-group meetings</li>
<li>There was talk of reviewing “classic” bioinformatics methods papers, but that has not happened yet. Choosing papers that are more relevant to everyone in the core group would make this more engaging and worth-wile. Also making sure paper presentations are the correct length/scope.</li>
<li>More discussion based</li>

<li>Yes, somewhat useful. Yearly seems adequate.</li>
<li>Yes, it felt more useful the first time we did it. Its pretty long and since there were no drastic changes from last year so it felt a bit redundant at times. Yearly is probably the correct interval but maybe extract some questions sections out for their own survey, for instance the “Mentoring” questions may be best to ask after we have done performance reviews/career meetings for the year so that experience is fresh. I think if it was more concise I could be more sure I gave high quality answers for each point.</li>
<li>Yes, annually is ok</li>
<li>Yes, yearly sounds perfect</li>
<li>Yes! Maybe twice a year</li>
<li>It is useful. As a collaborator, I found myself limited or found it somewhat hard to do the survey because I think many of the questions were specific to Leo’s team and culture, which I might not be familiar with. But, I would agree that doing this often will be helpful as a sanity check for the team environment.</li>
